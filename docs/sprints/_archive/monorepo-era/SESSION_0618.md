# SESSION 0618 — G-031 S2/S3: formalize /pp·/ppp + create /ggr

> **Pre-staged stub (ADR 0049), staged 2026-07-22 by SESSION_0617 bow-out.** Adopt at bow-in: flip
> `staged` → `in-progress`, run the FS-0035 canonical-occupancy check, then execute below.

## Operator

Brian + claude-session-0618

## Goal

Build the next two disjoint slices of **G-031** (lean session model, ratified in ADR 0052): **S2** formalize
`/pp`·`/ppp` and **S3** create `/ggr`. Both governance/docs — no deploy. Fan-out candidates.

## Next session

**Goal:** G-031 **S4 — facet migration** (`lane:`→`brand:` + add `stage:`). Staged as `SESSION_0619` stub.

**First task:** the mechanical rename sweep across **SESSION frontmatter** (`lane:`→`brand:`; add `stage:` =
`plan|build|qar`) + the **`--lane=` view filters** + the **ledger/board parser** (`ledger-backlog.ts` /
`board-backlog.ts` read the facet). Migrate in one sweep — existing SESSION files + tooling break until the
parser and the frontmatter agree (ADR 0052 Consequences). Prove: `ledger-backlog.ts` + `board-backlog.ts`
still run; a `--lane=`/`--brand=` filter returns the right set.

Inputs: [ADR 0052](../../../architecture/decisions/0052-lean-single-lane-baton-session-model.md) §Decision-2 +
§Consequences · [G-031](../../../knowledge/wiki/goals-ledger.md) · `scripts/ledger-backlog.ts` · `apps/web/scripts/board-backlog.ts`.

**Then:** S5 (`opening.md`/`closing.md` full discover-then-load rework — HIGH, own Build+QAR; the 3-questions
+ SotD mechanization already landed 0618) → S6 (settle ADR 0052).

## Bow-in

- **Canonical-occupancy (FS-0035):** canonical is **free** (clean tree, no `.canonical-session`,
  no other uncommitted SESSION file). Claim written for SESSION_0618.
- **Guard-script bug found (new FS candidate):** `scripts/canonical-claim.sh check|claim` exits **1
  silently on a clean tree** — `occ_git="$(other_uncommitted_sessions | head -1)"` under
  `set -euo pipefail` dies when the inner `grep` matches nothing (the normal bow-in state), so the
  *enforced* FS-0035 gate is a no-op on its most common path and never writes the claim file. Worked
  around by writing `.canonical-session` manually. → fix candidate this session (TASK_03) / FS row.
- **Parallel-lane assessment (step 1d):** 2 candidates (S2, S3). File sets are **largely disjoint**
  (`.claude/skills/pp,ppp/` vs `.claude/skills/ggr/`) but both small markdown skill-authoring tasks
  sharing one edited file (`skills-index.md` SSL rows). **Not routed to fan-out** — worktree overhead
  is unjustified for two ~1–3-file markdown skills; run as one coherent inline Build lane.
- **Ledger scan:** 110 open items; no open PRs. Task is operator-pinned by this stub (S2/S3), which
  wins on precedence over the ledger rank.

## Petey plan

### Goal

Build G-031 slices **S2** (`/pp`·`/ppp`) and **S3** (`/ggr`) per [ADR 0052](../../../architecture/decisions/0052-lean-single-lane-baton-session-model.md)
decisions D1/D4/D5/D6 — three invocable skill entrypoints over existing protocol bodies, then retire
SSL-001/002/003.

### Tasks

#### SESSION_0618_TASK_01 — S2: `/pp` + `/ppp` skills

- **Agent:** Cody
- **What:** Two skill entrypoints over the existing `petey-plan.md` body — `/pp` = Parse→Plan
  (plan-only, preserved for bow-out staging), `/ppp` = `/pp` + emit the paste-ready baton prompt.
- **Done means:** `.claude/skills/pp/SKILL.md` + `.claude/skills/ppp/SKILL.md` exist and invoke;
  `petey-plan.md` cross-links them; SSL-001/002 retired from `skills-index.md`.
- **Depends on:** nothing.

#### SESSION_0618_TASK_02 — S3: `/ggr` skill

- **Agent:** Cody
- **What:** Giddy Gate Review skill — wraps `seq-review-wave` + `/code-quality` (`code-quality-matrix`)
  + `hostile-close-review` + **`/fallow-fix-loop`** (operator add mid-session: the D3/D5 metrics source
  AND the auto-loop's fix executor); gate policy ≥9.0 clears · 7.0–8.9 auto-loops ≤2 Giddy passes then
  operator gate · hard-caps always loop; rubric flexes by lane (Build→matrix /10; Plan→plan-quality).
- **Done means:** `.claude/skills/ggr/SKILL.md` exists and invokes; SSL-003 retired.
- **Depends on:** nothing (disjoint from TASK_01 except the shared `skills-index.md` edit).

#### SESSION_0618_TASK_03 — Fix `canonical-claim.sh` clean-tree bug (elected add-on)

- **Agent:** Cody
- **What:** Make the guard tolerant of the no-match `grep` under `pipefail` so `check`/`claim` print
  their verdict and write the claim file on a clean tree; add an FS row.
- **Done means:** `scripts/canonical-claim.sh check --session NNNN` on a clean tree exits 0 with
  "✅ free"; `claim` writes `.canonical-session`; FS entry logged.
- **Depends on:** nothing.

### Open decisions (surfaced for operator sign-off before build)

1. **Skill mechanism for "ONE petey-plan skill, two modes" (ADR 0052 D1).** Claude Code maps a slash
   command to a skill *directory name*, so "one skill / two modes" becomes **two thin entrypoints over
   one shared body** — recommend `.claude/skills/pp/` + `.claude/skills/ppp/`, both pointing at
   `petey-plan.md`, with `/ppp` = `/pp` + the baton-emit step (mirrors `/gq`↔`/graphify-query`). Confirm.
2. **Does `/ggr` wire into `closing.md` this session?** ADR 0052 D5 says `/ggr` folds into bow-out, but
   the ritual rework is slice **S5** (own Build+QAR). Recommend: build the `/ggr` skill artifact now
   (S3), **defer** the closing.md fold to S5 to avoid scope creep. Confirm.
3. **Include TASK_03** (guard-script fix) in this lane, or split to its own FS-fix session? Recommend
   include — it's a 2-line fix to a gate that's silently broken and squarely governance-lane.

### Risks

- Shared `skills-index.md` edit across TASK_01/02 — single sequential edit owner (no parallel worktrees),
  so no conflict. Governance/docs only — `vercel.json ignoreCommand` skips the prod build (no deploy).

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SESSION_0618_TASK_01 | ✅ done | inline Cody | `/pp` + `/ppp` SKILL.md exist + registered; SSL-001/002 retired |

| SESSION_0618_TASK_04 | ✅ done | inline Cody | 3 Petey questions + SotD ask mechanized into `/bow-in`+`/bow-out` skill bodies + numbered step 6b; FS-0037 logged |

## What landed

- **S2 — `/pp` · `/ppp`:** `.claude/skills/pp/SKILL.md` (Parse→Plan, plan-only) + `.claude/skills/ppp/SKILL.md`
  (`/pp` + emit the baton), two thin entrypoints over the existing `petey-plan.md` body (operator-confirmed
  two-dir shared-body mechanism). Both registered (Claude Code surfaced them mid-session).
- **S3 — `/ggr`:** `.claude/skills/ggr/SKILL.md` — universal QAR gate; rubric flexes by lane; ≥9.0 clears ·
  7.0–8.9 auto-loops ≤2 · hard-caps always loop; wraps `seq-review-wave` + `/code-quality` +
  `hostile-close-review` + **`/fallow-fix-loop`** (metrics + fix executor). Registered.
- **SSL:** SSL-001/002/003 retired from `skills-index.md`; generated table regenerated (`bun
  scripts/skills-index.ts` — 55 skills). Backlog now SSL-004/005/006 only.
- **FS-0036 (bonus find + fix):** `scripts/canonical-claim.sh` was a silent no-op on a clean tree (the
  FS-0035 gate never enforced on its most common path). Fixed at the function (`|| true` on the no-match
  pipeline); all three paths (free / claim-writes / occupied) verified.
- **TASK_04 — 3-questions/SotD mechanization (operator-caught, FS-0037):** the bow-in three-questions + SotD
  publish ask (added 0617 as trailing `opening.md` prose) was **skipped this very session** because it wasn't
  in the executed skill body. Fixed **both halves** (operator elected): mandatory `AskUserQuestion` step added
  to `/bow-in` + `/bow-out` **skill bodies** (executed path) **and** promoted to numbered `opening.md` **step
  6b** + strengthened `closing.md` §6d. Trailing prose slimmed to rationale-only (no drift).

## Follow-ups (not this session)

- **S4** — facet migration `lane:`→`brand:` + add `stage:` (mechanical sweep across SESSION frontmatter +
  `--lane=` filters + ledger/board parser).
- **S5** — `opening.md`/`closing.md` rework to fold `/ggr` into bow-out + the discover-then-load bow-in
  (HIGH — own Build+QAR). `/ggr`'s closing.md wiring lives here.
- **S6** — retire/settle ADR 0052 build tracking.

## Review log

**Hostile close review (inline — proportionate: docs/governance, no runtime/security/data surface; sub-agent
dispatch skipped to avoid clobbering the dirty tree per [[workflow-over-dirty-tree-clobbers-edits]]).**
Verified: all 5 authored doc cross-links + 5 sibling-skill links resolve; no `### 6b` step collision in
`opening.md`; `/ggr`'s "≥9.0 clears" matches `code-quality-matrix §5` (9.0–9.4 = Strong/ship-with-follow-ups).
`canonical-claim.sh` fix proven on all 3 paths. **Verdict: GO.** Non-blocking note: two `[rule-name]` mnemonic
refs in the skills render as literal text (name the memory, not a link — acceptable).

## Reflections

- The operator caught the real bug I didn't: the 3-questions/SotD step **added last session** (0617) failed to
  fire **this session** — because it was trailing prose after `opening.md` step 7, not in the executed skill
  body. Third instance of one meta-pattern in a single session (FS-0035 prose→script, FS-0036 script broke on
  the default path, FS-0037 governance step as unreachable prose): **a rule only fires from the read-path that
  actually executes.** The fix that matters is structural (asks in the skill body), not more prose.
- The FS-0035 guard shipping broken (FS-0036) is a caution on "mechanized = safe": a gate's verification must
  exercise its **default/negative path**, not only the positive trigger it was written for.
