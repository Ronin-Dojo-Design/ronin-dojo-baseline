# SESSION 0149 — Membership Detail Page + Role Assignment Management

## Date

2026-05-12

## Operator

Brian Scott + Copilot (Petey → Cody)

## Goal

Build the Membership admin detail page (view/edit single membership, status transition actions, role assignment management). This was the staged next-session scope from SESSION_0148.

## Status

in-progress

## Failed Steps / Drift Check

- Carried blockers from 0148:
  - 🔴 Resend domain DNS pending verification — 37th session carried (blocks live email send)
  - 🟡 Docker Desktop not running — MinIO untested (carried from 0131)
  - 🟡 `cuid()` vs `cuid2()` whole-schema migration deferred (finding 0136-02)
  - 🟡 ClassAttendance model needed before punch card runtime tracking
  - 🟡 Membership transition audit trail needed before launch
  - 🟡 oRPC vs adminActionClient L1 divergence — add to drift register

## Dirstarter Alignment Table

| Field | Answer |
| --- | --- |
| Dirstarter baseline touched | Admin detail page pattern (L1 — leads `[id]/page.tsx` with status actions + form) |
| Extension or replacement | Extension — Membership detail + role assignment are L2 (not in Dirstarter) |
| Why justified | Admin needs to view/edit individual memberships, transition status, and manage role assignments |
| Risk if bypassed | Admin can only see list view — no way to manage roles or view full membership details |

## Graphify Check

- Graph status: ≤1 commit behind HEAD (updated end of SESSION_0148)
- Query 1: `"membership detail page view edit role assignment management admin"` → found leads detail page (`app/admin/leads/[id]/`), roles admin (`app/admin/roles/`), memberships server layer, auth HOC, shared components
- Query 2: `"findMembershipById membership detail admin edit form"` → found `server/admin/memberships/queries.ts` (existing `findMembershipById`), `server/admin/memberships/actions.ts` (transition + delete), memberships table components
- Files selected from graph:
  - `app/admin/leads/[id]/page.tsx` — L1 detail page pattern (Wrapper + status actions + form + panels)
  - `app/admin/leads/[id]/_components/lead-status-actions.tsx` — L1 status action buttons pattern (useAction + toast + router.refresh)
  - `app/admin/invites/[id]/page.tsx` — simpler read-only detail page
  - `server/admin/memberships/queries.ts` — `findMembershipById` (includes user, org, discipline, roleAssignments.role, rank)
  - `server/admin/memberships/actions.ts` — `transitionMembershipStatus`, `deleteMemberships`
  - `server/admin/memberships/schema.ts` — `VALID_TRANSITIONS` state machine
  - `server/admin/roles/queries.ts` — `findRoleList` (id, name, code)
  - `server/admin/roles/actions.ts` — pattern for role CRUD via `adminActionClient`

## Petey Plan

### Goal

Deliver Membership admin detail page with: (1) read-only membership info display, (2) status transition action buttons following the VALID_TRANSITIONS state machine, (3) role assignment management (add/remove roles from the membership). Server layer for membership queries/transitions already exists — need new actions for role assignment only.

### Design Decisions (resolved up front)

1. **Detail page pattern**: Follow leads `[id]/page.tsx` — `withAdminPage` → fetch membership + role list → `Wrapper` with status actions panel + info display + role management panel.
2. **Status transitions**: Reuse `transitionMembershipStatus` action. UI shows valid transition buttons per `VALID_TRANSITIONS` (same state machine from list page row actions, but as full buttons like `lead-status-actions.tsx`).
3. **Role assignment**: New server actions needed — `assignRoleToMembership` and `removeRoleFromMembership`. These create/delete `MembershipRoleAssignment` records. UI shows current roles with remove buttons + a role selector to add new roles.
4. **No edit form for core fields** this session: Membership's core fields (org, discipline, rank, status) are managed via transitions and admin workflows, not free-form edit. Detail page is primarily read + actions. Edit form deferred to a future session if needed.

### Tasks

#### TASK_01 — Role assignment server actions
- **Agent:** Cody
- **What:** Add `assignRoleToMembership` and `removeRoleFromMembership` actions to `server/admin/memberships/actions.ts`. Add Zod schemas for both.
- **Steps:**
  1. Add `assignRoleSchema` (membershipId + roleId) and `removeRoleSchema` (membershipId + roleId) to `server/admin/memberships/schema.ts`
  2. Add `assignRoleToMembership` action — creates `MembershipRoleAssignment`, revalidates
  3. Add `removeRoleFromMembership` action — deletes `MembershipRoleAssignment`, revalidates
- **Done means:** Actions compile, handle duplicate assignment gracefully (unique constraint)
- **Depends on:** nothing

#### TASK_02 — Membership detail page
- **Agent:** Cody
- **What:** Create `app/admin/memberships/[id]/page.tsx` with membership info display
- **Steps:**
  1. Create `app/admin/memberships/[id]/page.tsx` — `withAdminPage`, fetch `findMembershipById` + `findRoleList`, render `Wrapper` with status actions + info grid + role panel
  2. Info grid: member name/email, organization, discipline, status badge, rank, member number, joined/left dates
- **Done means:** Detail page renders with full membership info
- **Depends on:** nothing (can parallel with TASK_01 — page shell doesn't need role actions yet)

#### TASK_03 — Membership status actions component
- **Agent:** Cody
- **What:** Create `app/admin/memberships/[id]/_components/membership-status-actions.tsx` following `lead-status-actions.tsx` pattern
- **Steps:**
  1. Client component with `useAction` hooks for `transitionMembershipStatus`
  2. Show valid transition buttons from `VALID_TRANSITIONS[membership.status]`
  3. Toast on success/error, `router.refresh()`
  4. Show current status prominently
- **Done means:** Admin can transition membership status from detail page
- **Depends on:** TASK_02

#### TASK_04 — Role assignment management component
- **Agent:** Cody
- **What:** Create `app/admin/memberships/[id]/_components/role-assignment-panel.tsx`
- **Steps:**
  1. Client component showing current role assignments as badges/chips with remove button
  2. Role selector (dropdown/select from `roleList` prop, filtering out already-assigned roles)
  3. `useAction` for `assignRoleToMembership` and `removeRoleFromMembership`
  4. Toast on success/error, `router.refresh()`
- **Done means:** Admin can view, add, and remove roles from a membership
- **Depends on:** TASK_01, TASK_02

#### TASK_05 — Wire list page row link to detail
- **Agent:** Cody
- **What:** Update `memberships-table-columns.tsx` — make member name column link to `/admin/memberships/[id]`
- **Steps:**
  1. Wrap member name cell in `<Link href={/admin/memberships/${row.original.id}}>` 
- **Done means:** Clicking a membership in the list navigates to detail page
- **Depends on:** TASK_02

#### TASK_06 — Type check + verification
- **Agent:** Cody
- **What:** Run `bunx tsc --noEmit`, verify zero errors
- **Done means:** Zero TS errors
- **Depends on:** TASK_01–05

### Parallelism

TASK_01 and TASK_02 can run in parallel (no dependency). TASK_03 after TASK_02. TASK_04 after TASK_01 + TASK_02. TASK_05 after TASK_02. TASK_06 last.

### Agent Assignments

| Task | Agent | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TASK_01 | Cody | Small action + schema addition — clear execution |
| TASK_02 | Cody | Follow leads detail page pattern — clear execution |
| TASK_03 | Cody | Follow lead-status-actions pattern — clear execution |
| TASK_04 | Cody | New component but pattern is clear (badges + select + actions) |
| TASK_05 | Cody | One-line wiring change |
| TASK_06 | Cody | Verification |

---

## Pre-flight: Membership Detail Page + Role Assignment

### 1. Auth predicates planned

- [x] Session auth required (admin pages via `withAdminPage` HOC)
- [x] Brand column filtered (ADR 0004) — `adminActionClient` provides `ctx.brand`
- Authorization approach: `withAdminPage` HOC for page, `adminActionClient` for actions

### 2. Existing action scan

- `server/admin/memberships/actions.ts` — `transitionMembershipStatus`, `deleteMemberships` ✅ exist
- `server/admin/memberships/queries.ts` — `findMembershipById` ✅ exists (includes user, org, discipline, roleAssignments.role, rank)
- `server/admin/roles/queries.ts` — `findRoleList` ✅ exists (id, name, code)
- **Missing:** role assignment/removal actions → TASK_01

### 3. Data flow reference

- `MembershipRoleAssignment` — join table: membershipId + roleId, unique constraint on pair
- `VALID_TRANSITIONS` state machine governs status transition UI

### 4. Schema spot-check

- `findMembershipById` returns: user (id, name, email), organization (id, name), discipline (id, name), roleAssignments[].role (id, name, code), rank (id, name)
- `MembershipRoleAssignment`: id, assignedAt, membershipId, roleId — `@@unique([membershipId, roleId])`

### 5. FAILED_STEPS check

- Prior failures in this area: none
- Manual Boundary Registry entries: none

## Decisions Resolved

- Detail page is read-only info grid + actions (no free-form edit form this session)
- Role assignment uses upsert to handle duplicate gracefully
- Button variants: primary for ACTIVE transition, destructive for SUSPENDED/CANCELLED, ghost for EXPIRED, secondary for PENDING

## Open Decisions / Blockers

- 🔴 Resend domain DNS pending verification — 37th session carried (blocks live email send)
- 🟡 Docker Desktop not running — MinIO untested (carried from 0131)
- 🟡 `cuid()` vs `cuid2()` whole-schema migration deferred (finding 0136-02)
- 🟡 ClassAttendance model needed before punch card runtime tracking
- 🟡 Membership transition audit trail needed before launch
- 🟡 oRPC vs adminActionClient L1 divergence — add to drift register

## Next Session

- **Goal:** SESSION_0150 — Membership edit form (rank/discipline changes) + transition audit trail
- **Inputs to read:** SESSION_0149 (this session), SESSION_0148 (list page)
- **First task:** Add `updateMembership` action for rank/discipline edits, create edit form component on detail page

## Reflections

- **VALID_TRANSITIONS in schema.ts caused a Turbopack client/server boundary issue.** The `schema.ts` file imports `createSearchParamsCache` from `nuqs/server`, which Turbopack chunks as server-only. Client components importing `VALID_TRANSITIONS` from the same file triggered `Cannot use import statement outside a module`. Fix: extract shared constants to a separate `constants.ts` file that has no server-only imports. This is a pattern to follow for any shared constant used by both server and client code.
- **SESSION_0146 was discovered stuck at `in-progress`** — an unclean close from a previous session. Fixed to `closed-unclean` during this session's full close sweep.
- **Sessions 0143–0149 had zero project-log entries** — 7 sessions of debt. Backfilled during full close. This suggests the quick-close ritual isn't enforcing the project-log gate consistently.
- **The membership admin arc (0145 → 0148 → 0149) is now complete** for list + detail + role assignment. The remaining gap is edit form + transition audit trail.

## Hostile Close Review — Batch: Sessions 0147–0149

### Giddy (Architecture + Dirstarter Compliance)

**1. Plan sanity:** Plans for 0147–0149 were well-scoped, single-concern sessions. Each followed the pattern: Petey plan → Cody executes → type check. No invalid assumptions found — each session built on verified server layer from prior sessions.

**2. Dirstarter compliance:** All three sessions extended L1 patterns without replacing them:
- 0147: Invite CRUD followed tools/leads admin page pattern exactly (withAdminPage, DataTable, form, detail page)
- 0148: Membership list page followed identical pattern with faceted filters
- 0149: Membership detail page followed leads `[id]/page.tsx` pattern (Wrapper + status actions + info grid)
- `VALID_TRANSITIONS` extraction to `constants.ts` is a necessary pattern divergence (Turbopack boundary), not a bypass

**Dirstarter docs check:** cached docs sufficient — these sessions didn't touch Dirstarter-owned layers (auth, payments, storage, deployment). Admin CRUD patterns are L1 but well-established in the codebase.
**Sources:** `docs/knowledge/wiki/dirstarter-component-inventory.md`, existing admin pages (leads, tools, tags)
**Verdict:** aligned

### Doug (QA + Security)

**3. Security:** No new auth paths introduced. All pages use `withAdminPage` HOC. All actions use `adminActionClient` which enforces session + brand. Role assignment actions (`assignRoleToMembership`, `removeRoleFromMembership`) use `adminActionClient` — admin-only. No public endpoints created.

**4. Data integrity:** `MembershipRoleAssignment` has `@@unique([membershipId, roleId])` — duplicate assignments prevented at DB level. `assignRoleToMembership` uses `upsert` to handle the race gracefully. `transitionMembershipStatus` enforces `VALID_TRANSITIONS` state machine server-side — UI shows only valid buttons, but server also validates.

**5. Lifecycle proof:** Invite → Claim → Membership creation (0147) feeds into Membership list (0148) → detail view + role management (0149). The user journey from invite through to active membership with roles is now admin-visible.

**6. Verification honesty:** `bunx tsc --noEmit` passed in all three sessions. No runtime tests. Browser verification was attempted in 0149 and caught a Turbopack chunk error — root cause identified (nuqs/server boundary), fix applied (constants.ts extraction). **Gap: no E2E or integration tests for membership CRUD or role assignment.**

**7. Workflow honesty:** Sessions followed bow-in/plan/execute/close pattern. Task IDs used. Project-log entries were missing for 0143–0149 (now backfilled).

**8. Merge readiness:** Code compiles, patterns are consistent, no known runtime errors after fix. Ready for next implementation session. Not ready for production — missing: E2E tests, transition audit trail, edit form.

### Kaizen Reflection

**1. Is this safe and secure?**
- Admin-only access is provably enforced (HOC + action client). Brand scoping is enforced by `adminActionClient` context.
- What's documented but not proven: actual runtime behavior of role assignment panel (no browser screenshot). Tests that would close gaps: E2E test for assign/remove role, E2E test for status transition from detail page.

**2. How many failed steps could we have prevented?**
- 1 failed step: Turbopack chunk error from `VALID_TRANSITIONS` in `schema.ts`. Prevention: establish a code guardrail rule — "never import from a `schema.ts` file that uses `nuqs/server` in a `"use client"` component; use a separate `constants.ts` for shared values."
- 1 process gap: 7 sessions without project-log entries. Prevention: add project-log check to quick-close checklist (it's in the protocol but wasn't enforced).

**3. Confidence at scale:**
- 100 users: 8/10 — admin pages work, role assignment is idempotent (upsert), state machine is server-enforced
- 1,000 users: 7/10 — no pagination on role assignments per membership (unlikely to be >10 roles, but unverified), no transition audit trail
- 10,000 users: 6/10 — no E2E tests, no load testing on membership queries with joins, no transition audit trail for compliance

**Kaizen aggregate: 7** — stage remediation session for E2E tests + transition audit trail before further membership feature work.

### Score gate

Kaizen aggregate 7 → per protocol: "Stage a remediation session covering the gaps before the next implementation session."

**Recommendation:** SESSION_0150 should be a remediation session adding:
1. Transition audit trail model + wiring
2. E2E test for membership detail page + role assignment
3. Code guardrail G-NEW: "no nuqs/server imports in client components"

## ADR / Ubiquitous Language Check

- No new ADR needed — role assignment and status transitions follow existing patterns
- No new domain terms introduced
- `VALID_TRANSITIONS` constant extraction is a code organization concern, not architectural
