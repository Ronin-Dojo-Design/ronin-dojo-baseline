/**
 * SESSION_0513: the claim/onboarding EMAILS no longer embed a magic-link token. A one-shot
 * `…/magic-link/verify?token=…` link (single-use, 7-day) was consumed by mail scanners /
 * late clicks → dead link (Tony Hua + Bob got "The Long Road" with a dead CTA). The durable
 * fix is `bindPendingClaim(email, nodeId)` + `buildClaimSignInUrl(baseUrl)`: bind the
 * email→node once (90-day TTL), and point the email at a plain `/auth/login` URL that never
 * expires. `lib/auth.ts` reconciliation claims the bound node on the recipient's NEXT sign-in
 * (Google OR magic link). `mintClaimMagicLink` (below) is RETAINED for any non-email caller but
 * is no longer what the email flows embed.
 *
 * Shared magic-link minter for the BBL self-serve claim / free-signup flow
 * (SESSION_0418). Extracted from `scripts/send-bbl-claim-emails.ts` so BOTH the
 * bulk announcement script AND the public Join-the-Legacy action mint the SAME
 * email-bound, single-use magic link.
 *
 * The recipient's click chain is:
 *   email link → /api/auth/magic-link/verify (sets the session cookie, outside the
 *   gated `(web)` group) → redirects straight to the `callbackURL` == `nextPath`,
 *   either the token-accept route (`/lineage/claim/accept?node=…`, which one-click
 *   claims the node) or `/me` (a plain free signup that just needs an account).
 *
 * SESSION_0440: the callbackURL was previously wrapped in a `/preview?token=…&next=…`
 * countdown-gate-bypass hop, but that produced a NESTED `?` for claim links which Better
 * Auth's double-decoding `originCheck` rejected with INVALID_CALLBACK_URL (see the
 * callbackURL note in `mintClaimMagicLink`). The gate is hard-off now, so the hop is gone.
 *
 * We call Better-Auth's `signInMagicLink` ONLY to CREATE the verification token
 * (email-bound, single-use, plugin-managed expiry), passing
 * `metadata: { skipEmail: true }` so the generic login email is suppressed — the
 * caller ships its own branded email carrying this link. The freshly-created
 * token is read back from the same DB (storeToken defaults to "plain", so
 * `Verification.identifier` IS the token). `signInMagicLink` requires a `Headers`
 * object even outside a request, so we synthesize one pinned to the BBL host.
 *
 * ⚠ Callers MUST mint SERIAL (one recipient at a time): the `value contains
 * "email":"<email>"` read-back + `orderBy desc` can grab a sibling's token if
 * two mints interleave.
 *
 * Both `auth` and this read-back share the app `db` (a single DB), so the token
 * BA just committed is visible here — no cross-client pool surprises.
